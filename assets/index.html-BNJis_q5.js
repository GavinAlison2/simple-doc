This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p><p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
