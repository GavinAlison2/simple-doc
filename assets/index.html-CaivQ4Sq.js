Once you <code>eject</code>, you can&#39;t go back!</strong></p><p>If you aren&#39;t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can <code>eject</code> at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p><p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you&#39;re on your own.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn&#39;t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn&#39;t be useful if you couldn&#39;t customize it when you are ready for it.</p><h2 id="learn-more" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learn-more"><span>Learn More</span></a></h2><p>You can learn more in the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create React App documentation</a>.</p><p>To learn React, check out the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React documentation</a>.</p><h3 id="code-splitting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#code-splitting"><span>Code Splitting</span></a></h3><p>This section has moved here: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting</a></p><h3 id="analyzing-the-bundle-size" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#analyzing-the-bundle-size"><span>Analyzing the Bundle Size</span></a></h3><p>This section has moved here: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size</a></p><h3 id="making-a-progressive-web-app" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#making-a-progressive-web-app"><span>Making a Progressive Web App</span></a></h3><p>This section has moved here: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app</a></p><h3 id="advanced-configuration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advanced-configuration"><span>Advanced Configuration</span></a></h3><p>This section has moved here: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration</a></p><h3 id="deployment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deployment"><span>Deployment</span></a></h3><p>This section has moved here: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment</a></p><h3 id="npm-run-build-fails-to-minify" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify"><span><code>npm run build</code> fails to minify</span></a></h3><p>This section has moved here: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify</a></p>',33)]))}const p=t(o,[["render",i]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/guide/React/my-todo/","title":"Getting Started with Create React App","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Available Scripts","slug":"available-scripts","link":"#available-scripts","children":[{"level":3,"title":"npm start","slug":"npm-start","link":"#npm-start","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"npm test","slug":"npm-test","link":"#npm-test","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"npm run build","slug":"npm-run-build","link":"#npm-run-build","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"npm run eject","slug":"npm-run-eject","link":"#npm-run-eject","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Learn More","slug":"learn-more","link":"#learn-more","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Code Splitting","slug":"code-splitting","link":"#code-splitting","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Analyzing the Bundle Size","slug":"analyzing-the-bundle-size","link":"#analyzing-the-bundle-size","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Making a Progressive Web App","slug":"making-a-progressive-web-app","link":"#making-a-progressive-web-app","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Advanced Configuration","slug":"advanced-configuration","link":"#advanced-configuration","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Deployment","slug":"deployment","link":"#deployment","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"npm run build fails to minify","slug":"npm-run-build-fails-to-minify","link":"#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1744933759000,"contributors":[{"name":"alice","username":"alice","email":"921757697@qq.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/alice"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"a8c8ae3910976148d6fa18f1558a906b2439578f","time":1744933759000,"email":"921757697@qq.com","author":"alice","message":"react"}]},"filePathRelative":"guide/React/my-todo/README.md"}');export{p as comp,c as data};
