# MySQL RBO and CBO

## RBO

RBO stands for Row-Based Optimization. It is a technique used to optimize queries by considering the impact of each row on the overall query execution time. It is based on the idea that the execution time of a query can be reduced by optimizing the order in which the rows are processed.

## CBO

CBO stands for Cost-Based Optimization. It is a technique used to optimize queries by considering the impact of each operation on the overall query execution time. It is based on the idea that the execution time of a query can be reduced by optimizing the operations used in the query.

CBO is more complex than RBO, as it requires a more sophisticated analysis of the query execution plan and the cost of each operation. However, it can provide more accurate and reliable results in some cases.
